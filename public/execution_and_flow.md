Modeling Execution and Flow
===========================

These sites reveal the flow and state of a program to deepen our
understanding.

Learnable Programming
---------------------

[Learnable Programming](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming)
is a Bret Victor essay about coding environments. One of its key points
is that you should be able to see the progression of code state across
time as the program executes. So, if you have a variable, you might have
a timeline that shows how the value changes on each iteration. It’s not
clear from the essay if there is an actual editor of IDE he proposes, or
if these are concepts.

Jeff Atwood also has a great article on Victor’s ideas called
[Visualizing Code to Fail
Faster](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/03/visualizing-code-to-fail-faster.html).

Deprocess
---------

[Deprocess](http://benfry.com/deprocess/) is Ben Fry’s visualization of
a program flow. It’s mostly an art piece, but it’s an interesting way to
think about how you’d watch code change as it runs.
