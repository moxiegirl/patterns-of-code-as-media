# Patterns of Code As Media, Andrew Odewahn

This is a catalog of sites where code is a media object in and of its
own right. Weâ€™re not interested so much in the code itself (i.e., does
it work, how does it perform, etc), but how do we communicate **about**
code: what are the best ways to see, learn, and understand a topic.
People are learning in new ways, and we want to understand the patterns
that are emerging.

## Running the site locally

The site uses [harpjs](http://harpjs.com/) to build a site and [Atlas](https://atlas.oreilly.com/) to build the PDF, mobi, and epub.  To build the site:

* [Install harp](http://harpjs.com/docs/quick-start).  
* Clone the repo
* Run `harp server --port 4567`

When you want to build the site, clone the repo down again into another directory, create a gh-pages branch, and then run `harp compile . _new directory_`
